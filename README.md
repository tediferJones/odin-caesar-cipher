# odin-caesar-cipher
Caesar Cipher Project for TOP using Ruby

This function should take a string, as well as a shift factor, and return a string of shifted characters.

For example, caesar_cipher("a",1) should return "b" because the letter "b" is 1 shift over from the input, which is the letter "a"
